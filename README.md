# Deep Learning for Sign language Recognition

This project implements a deep learning model to detect and classify American Sign Language (ASL) gestures in real-time using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The system is designed to assist in communication by recognizing hand gestures and translating them into corresponding letters of the alphabet.

## Introduction
This project focuses on building a machine learning model capable of recognizing ASL hand gestures from images. The end goal is to aid communication for people with hearing or speech impairments by converting hand signals into text.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of images of hands performing ASL gestures. Each gesture corresponds to a letter in the American Sign Language alphabet. The dataset is preprocessed to fit the input requirements of our neural network.

- **Image Size**: 64x64 pixels
- **Classes**: 26 (A-Z)

The dataset can be downloaded from [Kaggle ASL Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/grassknoted/asl-alphabet).

## Model Architecture
The model is built using a CNN architecture, which is well-suited for image classification tasks. The architecture consists of several convolutional layers followed by max pooling and fully connected layers. The final output layer uses softmax activation to classify the hand gesture into one of the 26 ASL letters.

### Key Components:
- **Convolutional Layers**: Extract features from input images
- **Max Pooling**: Downsample the feature maps
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Map learned features to output classes
- **Activation Function**: ReLU for hidden layers, Softmax for output
